## Temperature Conversion Program

This repository contains a program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. The user is prompted to input a temperature value and its original unit of measurement. The program then converts the temperature to the other two units and displays the results.

### Example
For instance, if a user enters 25 degrees Celsius, the program will convert and display the equivalent temperatures in Fahrenheit and Kelvin.

### How to Use
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the temperature value.
3. Enter the original unit of measurement (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin).
4. The program will display the converted temperatures in the other two units.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x

### Running the Program
To run the program, execute the following command in your terminal:
```sh
python temperature_conversion.py
